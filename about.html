                    <h3>The History of G2 Melody</h3>
                    <p style="padding-right: 8%;">The entire idea of the choir was conceived ending <b>August 2016</b>. Back then the soul mission was purposely for the <b>Gospel Guardians TV program</b> which has just started at the moment. While some thought about this program, some thought about a choir which will be purposely for this TV program; a choir that will be involved in doing transitions with music when the preacher takes short breaks during his lessons.<br/>
                        </p>
                    <p style="padding-right: 8%;">But at the moment, starting a choir like that would demand more financial resources to employ the expertise of a music tutor and even in bringing youths together for this purpose. So, it was concluded that everything about the choir be put on hold and to commence effectively in five counting from 2016, that is, in 2021.</pstyle="padding-right: 8%;">

            <div class="col-xl-12 col-lg-12">
                <div class="about_info">
                    <p style="padding-right: 3%;">After a while, other ideas came in, asking for the choir to start small so that by 2021 the choir must have matured enough in terms of music to be able to handle the task required by the Gospel Guardians team. Ekwoge Blaise and Andy Leroy[Preacher of Muea congregation] who are both members of the GG team, decided to share the idea to some youths around Buea and it was welcomed by many at the time. This idea moved from being just an idea into something real, with the name <b>Melodious Voices</b> as the choir started. After a while with all the challenges that came to train people, many people knew it was a matter of time before the whole franchise of building a choir like this to come to an end. The music director[MD], Ekwoge Blaise, who took up the responsibility to assist in the training process being a member of the Gospel Guardians team, though mostly always present had little or no idea about music, singing and even about coordinating or teaching people how to do this. His inability bundled with the inconsistency of many of the member, after a while, many people started falling off which was a big challenge to him to be able to continue with a choir like this or even pursuing the whole vision about a choir. In fact, there were periods where only 1 or 2 members were left but their warmth, love and prayers and that of many was what was needed to fuel the moral and hopes of this young committed enthusiastic servant of God.</p>

                    <h3>G2's Journey Continues</h3>
                    <p>With time, the choir decided to restructure her goals and to start things all over. In 2017 since they wanted the choir to be solely for the TV program, they now change the name from <b>Melodious Voices to Gospel Guardian Melody (G2 Melody)</b>. From there, they revamp the goals of the choir.</p>
                    <p>At the start, the goal of the choir was solely for the TV program, <b>to be able to evangelize through music</b>. But this was extended with the opening of the radio program for the choir to record songs that would be used even for the radio. This left from the TV program to the radio to incorporate other areas where the <b>hearts of many can be reached through music like in prison, hospitals, orphanage and others</b>. The choir added yet another goal, this extended to the church, seeing how poor music has been in the church through the years here in Cameroon. Due to this, <b>G2 aimed at church growth</b> where they started moving locally from congregation to congregation, teaching music during their programmed music classes, extending even to some Bible studies on Sundays during every month. G2 equally seek to extend their <b>love to pull youths together</b>, to be able to share in what they are after as they make music of the church; <b>Acapella</b>. </p>

                    <h3>Commitment, Determination, Believe!</h3>
                    <p style="padding-right: 8%;">They continued to struggle with little or no experience, but things started to turn around mid-2018. <b>In 2018, the choir had their very first properly transcribed song</b> by a friend of the MD who gave him a copy of <b>“Ancient Word”</b>. This changed the mentality of the young and tender choir towards learning and growing. In August 2018, after one of their presentation at a gathering of youths all over Cameroon who gathered for a one-week prayer session as they do every year, more people develop a lot of interest in joining this choir.</p>
                    <p style="padding-right: 8%;">This growth through Christ made them to start all over, re-brand the choir, come up with concise goals and started doing proper music training, seeing how many were interested at the little they did. Now the choir didn’t just think to give it another shot, they now came with the belief that it can be done. They set for themselves an even bigger target, to record their own songs and to come out with an album of their own. To do this, many sacrificed so the choir could get the services of Mr Anu George (Junior Praize as he is commonly reffered). He warmly welcomed the idea and though he visited the choir only about 4 times during this period, he helped ignite the steam the entire choir needed to kick start again, but this time with a stronger belief and determination and motivation.</p>

                    <h3>Love is the answer!</h3>
                    <p>In November, this beautiful choir started putting things in order, the timing was a good one because the choir was preparing for a studio record and also was preparing for the wedding of one of her choristers in December. While doing all of those it made them work a little hard making them gain some familiarity when it comes to singing and reading music.</p>
                    <p>In December 2018, they had their very first presentation in a public, a wedding, from there they saw so many reasons to continue the choir and to aim even higher and bigger, they started setting targets.</p>
                    <p>In 2019, they continued with the plan to record an album which they already titled, <b>“Unfathomable Love”;An expression of how far God have carried them as they seek to bless</b> the lives of many through the kind of music they make. </p>
                    <p>December 2019 came with the launch of their very first <b>audio album and a video release of one of their song title: "Love"</b>. This launch equally meant they were able to host their very first concert all thanks to God. </p>

                    <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
                    <p style="padding-right: 8%;">The choir has faced so many challenges. It has not been easy getting the personnel’s involved to train the choir when it started, most people who were interested left due to the different commitment, it was even more strenuous on the choristers who showed interest and those who left from different congregations to meet up with the days for rehearsals. The choir too could not meet with finance to uplift the personnel they wanted.</p>
                    <p style="padding-right: 8%;">Another major challenge was one could hardly have the same set of choristers being present during rehearsals, there were times where one set would be there for rehearsals when a song is taught, the next session it will be another set and the process repeated itself for months. This made it very hard for the music director and even on the one or two members who were always there. Aside that, parents kept pulling their children off the choir and when the choir performs well or get better, they send them back and those who are just coming will be pulling the others behind. And the cycle seemed like an endless loop.</p>

                    <h3>Theocentric Harmony: Hope!</h3>
                    <p>So, in 2018 when the choir was reborn, the choir had to establish a membership and an authorization forms; that anyone who want to join the choir has to sign, together with a guardian. The membership form is a letter of commitment that each chorister has to sign to show that he or she will be fully engaged, abiding to the rules and regulations of the choir.</p>
                    <p>Aside the above-mentioned challenges, the choir has had a lot of support from some brothers and sisters who didn’t give up on the choir and right now the choir is working on an album together with other projects, like planning for their very first musical concert. More help keeps coming from others all over the world with each person support the choir in their own way; financially, morally, physically and most importantly spiritually.</p>
